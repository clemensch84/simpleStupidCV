# SimpleStupidCV

Attention! This project is not meant to be served!!!

I wanted to use Angular to create my CV instead of known and hated word processing programs.
This gave much more flexibility and freedom for design and arrangement.

You can adapt the code to yor own needs to create you own CV. 
You can use the print button in the upper right corner to open the print dialogue of your browser
for creating beautiful PDFs. 

Currently only tested on Chrome for Mac

Please be careful to not share any sensitive or personal data! 

Have fun!
